 If we don't turn on flex-wrap, align cotent does nothing for us.


 Align-self is similar to align items, except that it's actually
 a style that we add to individual items, as opposed to an entire
 container or section - as is the case with align-items.


 It doesn't necessarily need to be individual items, we could
 also style individual group of elements.

 To style on the fifth element in the container, we do:

 div:nth-of-type(5){
    align-self: center;
 }

 FLEX SHORTHAND

/* Three Values: flex-grow | flex-shrink | flex-basis */
 Flex: 2 2 10%;

 If you have two values, then:
 Two Values: flex-grow | flex-shrink
 Flex 2 2;

 If you have two values, but one of them is a width, or
 pixel, or em, then:
 Two Values: flex-grow | flex-basis
 Flex 2 20px;


 And if you just have one value, with no unit, it's going to 
 be flex-grow by default.

 One Value: flex-grow
 Flex: 2;
